# ContinuumModels_singleparticle
Single particle calculations for continuum models: band structure, DOS, Fermi surfaces

Programming language: Fortran90 + Gnuplot

Repository devoted to Dirac continuum models for twisted Van der Waals materials. A distinction is made for Γ- and K-valley models. 
Chemical potential (in eV or number of electrons per ???) can be selected by modifying an initial line of the main code for each material.
Band structure along the Γ-K-M-Γ path of the miniBZ.
